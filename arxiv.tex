\section*{Impact Statement}
This work was written out of concern that work easily recognized as `impactful' in current AI research and development, can also easily be over- and misinterpreted. As such, in the current climate of high market demand for AI innovations, we see risks of too-eager adoption in real-world applications, which may have serious societal impact. Thus, in this work we emphasize that an academic's impact also is in being able to thoroughly question made claims, and being explicitly aware of one's own biases. While the AI publishing landscape has to our feeling transformed too much into a noisy race to get exciting results in fast, we hope the research community can create more room for this type of deeper questioning.
