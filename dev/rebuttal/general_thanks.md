We would like to thank all of the reviewers for their efforts. All of your reviews have struck us as detailed, thoughtful and useful. We do not take this for granted in times when reviewers are typically very overburdened and so we are very appreciative. We are also happy to see that our work has generally been received quite positively by the reviewers.

You will find individual responses below. To save space, we do not again thank each of you individually for your efforts and get straight to the point. Our initial draft rebuttals for each of you were much more detailed but we appreciate that the 2,500-character limit serves to protect everyone's precious time. Still, should any of you want to see additional details, please be welcome to ask for them and we will be happy to point you to a more detailed rebuttal hosted on our anonymized git repository. 

Many thanks again for all your efforts,

The authors
